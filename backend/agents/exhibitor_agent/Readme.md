## Intelligence Pipeline

```
Query (category, geography, audience_size)
        │
        ▼
 Step 1: Similar Event Filtering
   ├── Category similarity  (weight: 0.50)
   ├── Geography match      (weight: 0.30)
   └── Audience proximity   (weight: 0.20)
        │
        ▼
 Step 2: Exhibitor Extraction
   └── Pool all exhibitors from similar events
        │
        ▼
 Step 3: Pattern Learning
   ├── Frequency distribution
   ├── Category-wise dominance
   └── Type trends (Startup vs Enterprise vs Tool/Platform)
        │
        ▼
 Step 4: Relevance Scoring
   Score = 0.4×Frequency + 0.3×Category + 0.2×Geography + 0.1×AudienceFit
   └── Normalised 0–100
        │
        ▼
 Step 5: Clustering
   ├── Rule-based: Startups / Enterprises / Tools+Platforms / Others
   └── ML KMeans (optional, sklearn)

 Step 6: Ranked Recommendations + Insights

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
cd exhibitor_agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the API
```bash
python main.py
# or
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 3. Make a recommendation request
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/recommend \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"category": "AI", "geography": "India", "audience_size": 3000}'
```

### 4. Swagger UI
Open: http://localhost:8000/docs

## API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |

| GET | `/health` | Agent health + dataset stats |
| GET | `/events/summary` | Dataset summary |
| POST | `/recommend` | Generate recommendations |

### Request Schema
```json
{
  "category": "AI",
  "geography": "India",
  "audience_size": 3000,

      "type": "Enterprise",
      "score": 95.4,
      "reason": "Appeared in 6 similar events; strong presence in India; established enterprise exhibitor.",

## Configuration

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `EVENTS_DATA_PATH` | `sample_data/events.json` | Path to your events JSON |

---

## Extending the Agent

### Plug into a Multi-Agent Orchestrator
```python
from agent import ExhibitorAgent
from models import RecommendationRequest

agent = ExhibitorAgent()
agent.load_data()

# Call from orchestrator
result = agent.run(RecommendationRequest(
    category="AI",
    geography="India",
    audience_size=3000
))
```

### Swap in your own dataset
Replace `sample_data/events.json` with any JSON matching:
```json
[
  {
    "event_id": "...",
    "event_name": "...",
    "category": "...",
    "location": "...",
    "country": "...",
    "audience_size": 2000,
    "year": 2024,
    "exhibitors": [
      {"name": "...", "type": "Enterprise|Startup|Tool|Platform|Others"}
    ]
  }
]
```

## Scoring Formula

```
Relevance Score =
  (0.40 × Frequency Score)       # How often in similar events (log-normalised)
  (0.30 × Category Match Score)  # Fraction of appearances in target category
  (0.20 × Geography Match Score) # Fraction of appearances in target geography
  (0.10 × Audience Fit Score)    # Gaussian fit to target audience size

Final score normalised 0–100.
